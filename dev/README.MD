Our bartender application will streamline the responsibilities of running a bar

the basic structure of how the bartender app works can be seen

`PROJECT OBJECTIVES(## Project Requirements)

    ### Option Two - Command Line CRUD App
    1. We use ActiveRecord to access/create a Sqlite3 Database
    2. We have 4 models: bar.rb, bartender.rb, customer.rb, and drink.rb
    3. We have a Cli method that runs in a true loop and breaks when the user
    inputs 'done'. that method also give the user full CRUD ability to :

        1. create_customer --C
        2. create_drink --C
        3. see all_drinks --R
        4. see all_customers --R
        5. update_customer --U
        6. delete_customer --D
        7. delete_drink --D

    4. We use good OO design patterns. there are separate classes for all 4 of
    the models. We also have a cli class in the /bin/cli.rb file`

### Instructions on running /bin/run.rb and using the bartender CRUD app

  1. run.rb first welcomes the user (a bartender) and ask for their name and
  years of experience. This will create a new_bartender instance. and then
  puts a list of the #bartender methods.

  2. a while true loop will start that breaks when the user enters 'exit'.

  3. other than that all CRUD capabilities of out application can be called
  inside this CLI REPL (cli.rb)
